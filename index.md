## welcome

I'm a PhD Candidate in Princeton's Politics Department and the Joint Degree Program in Social Policy at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.
My research covers topics on redistribution, poverty alleviation, inequality studies and public goods provision, with a regional focus in Latin America.

My dissertation project studies the process through which national and sub-national governments interact, coordinate and compete over the implementation of social policy and  more broadly the delivery of public goods. Using the case of Mexico, I use both a range of quantitative methods such as text analysis and spatial analysis, as well as qualitative evidence to measure the degree of overlap between jurisdictions of delivery, the political reasoning behind this phenomenon and how it ultimately affects the effective access to public services.

I am originally from Mexico City, where I earned a B.A in Economics at the Instituto Teconológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). After college, I worked for two years for the Mexican government as a public policy advisor at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), the main public healthcare provider in Mexico, and the largest in Latin America. During this time I was immersed in the world of health economics and public health. Moreover, I got a sense of the wide range of challenges that the state actors face to provide public services.
